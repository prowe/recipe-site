source: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/274653/oven-baked-chicken-wings/
ingredients:
  - cooking spray
  - 2 pounds chicken wings
  - ½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste
  - ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
  - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - ½ cup hot sauce
  - ½ tablespoon red wine vinegar
  - ½ tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
  - ½ tablespoon honey
  - ½ teaspoon garlic powder
  - ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
  - 2 stalks celery, sliced, or to taste
  - 2 carrots, sliced, or to taste
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.
  - Pat dry chicken wings with paper towels. Season with salt. Place flour into a shallow dish. Dredge wings in flour to lightly coat, then place on the prepared baking sheet.
  - Bake in the preheated oven until golden and no longer pink in the centers, 40 to 45 minutes.
  - While wings are baking, melt butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan. Add hot sauce, red wine vinegar, Worcestershire, honey, garlic powder, and cayenne. Let sauce simmer on low heat until wings are done baking, about 40 minutes.
  - Place wings in a large serving bowl. Pour sauce over wings; toss until evenly coated. Serve with celery and carrots.
