source: https://littlesunnykitchen.com/tater-tot-casserole/#wprm-recipe-container-42444
ingredients:
  - 2 pounds (900g) ground beef 80/20
  - ½ teaspoon kosher salt
  - ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
  - 1 medium yellow onion diced
  - 1 clove garlic minced
  - 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
  - ½ cup (120ml) whole milk
  - ½ cup (120ml) beef broth Note 1
  - 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
  - 1 cup (150g) frozen mixed vegetables corn, carrots, peas, green beans
  - 8 ounces (225g) cheddar cheese shredded, Note 2
  - 32 ounce (900g) bag frozen tater tots
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C and grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
  - In a skillet, cook ground beef until it's no longer pink and cooked through. Drain fat. Remove onto a plate and set aside.
  - Add onion, and cook until softened (2-3 minutes), add garlic and sauté for 30 seconds - 1 minute.
  - Add flour, and cook it for 30 seconds then add the milk, beef broth, and Worcestershire sauce. Whisk and cook on medium heat for 3 minutes or until the sauce has thickened.
  - Stir in the beef and frozen vegetables and remove from heat.
  - Layer the beef in the casserole dish, followed by the cheese, and arrange the tater tots on top in a single layer.
  - Bake for 30-40 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack, and cool for 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley or chives.
notes:
  - Beef broth can be substituted with beef, chicken, or vegetable stock.
  - Whenever possible, it's recommended you freshly grate your cheese from a block as it melts much better. Pre-shredded packaged cheese comes with anti-clumping agents (which is why it's not clumpy when it comes out of the bag) which stop it from melting as nicely.
