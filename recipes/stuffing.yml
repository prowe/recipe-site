title: Stuffing
source: https://www.loveandlemons.com/stuffing-recipe/
ingredients:
  - 1 small loaf (1 pound) day-old crusty sourdough bread, not sandwich bread
  - ½ cup salted butter, plus 1 tablespoon melted butter for topping
  - 2 leeks, halved, thinly sliced, and rinsed well (2 cups)
  - 4 celery stalks, diced (1¾ cups)
  - 3 garlic cloves, chopped
  - ¾ teaspoon sea salt
  - ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - ¼ cup chopped fresh sage
  - Heaping ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
  - 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
  - 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
  - 1½ to 2 cups vegetable broth
  - 2 large eggs, beaten
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 350°F and grease an 8x11 or 9x13-inch baking dish.
  - Tear the bread into 1-inch pieces* and place in a very large bowl.
  - Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks, celery, garlic, salt, and pepper, and sauté for 5 minutes, turning the heat to low halfway through. Pour the leek mixture over the bread and sprinkle with the sage, parsley, rosemary, and thyme. Use your hands to toss until coated. Pour 1½ cups of the broth evenly over the stuffing and toss to coat. Add the eggs and toss again. The bread should feel pretty wet. If it’s still a bit dry, mix in the remaining ½ cup of broth. The amount you use will depend on how dense and dry your bread was.
  - Transfer the mixture to the baking dish. If making ahead, stop here, cover the dish with foil, and store in the refrigerator until ready to bake.
  - When ready to bake, drizzle the 1 tablespoon melted butter on top and bake, covered, for 30 minutes. If the stuffing is still pretty wet, uncover the dish and bake for 5 to 10 more minutes to crisp the top a bit.
notes:
  - If your bread is not stale, spread the torn pieces in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in a 350°F oven to dry them out a bit before proceeding with the recipe.
