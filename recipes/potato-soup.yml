source: https://sugarspunrun.com/creamy-potato-soup-recipe/
ingredients:
  - 6 strips (uncooked) bacon cut into small pieces
  - 3 Tablespoons butter unsalted or salted will work
  - 1 medium yellow onion chopped (about 1.5 cup/200g)
  - 3 large garlic cloves minced
  - ⅓ cup all-purpose flour (42g)
  - 2 ½ lbs gold potatoes peeled and diced into pieces no larger than 1” (this was about 6 Large potatoes for me/1.15kg)
  - 4 cups chicken broth (945ml)
  - 2 cups milk (475ml)
  - ⅔ cup heavy cream (155ml)
  - 1 ½ teaspoon* salt
  - 1 teaspoon ground pepper
  - ¼ - ½ teaspoon ancho chili powder
  - ⅔ cup sour cream (160g)
  - Shredded cheddar cheese, chives, and additional sour cream and bacon for topping optional
steps:
  - Place bacon pieces in a large Dutch Oven or soup pot over medium heat and cook until bacon is crisp and browned.
  - Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.
  - Add butter and chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onions are tender (3-5 minutes).
  - Add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
  - Sprinkle the flour over the ingredients in the pot and stir until smooth (use whisk if needed).
  - Add diced potatoes to the pot along with chicken broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and ancho chili powder. Stir well.
  - Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork (about 10 minutes).
  - Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half*** of the soup to a blender (be careful, it will be hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup, but just eyeballing the amount will be fine. Alternatively you can use an immersion blender.).
  - Return the pureed soup to the pot and add sour cream and reserved bacon pieces, stir well.
  - Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving.
  - Top with additional sour cream, bacon, cheddar cheese, or chives. Enjoy!
