title: Turkey Gravy
source: https://downshiftology.com/recipes/gluten-free-turkey-gravy/#wprm-recipe-container-46329
ingredients:
  - 2 cups turkey drippings, or low-sodium chicken/turkey broth
  - 2 tablespoons arrowroot powder (or tapioca flour or cornstarch)
  - 2 tablespoons melted butter or ghee (or water for dairy-free)
  - kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper , to taste
steps:
  - Once the turkey is done roasting, remove the turkey from the pan and strain the pan drippings through a fine mesh sieve into a large measuring cup.
  - Let the drippings sit for a few minutes until the fat separates and rises to the top. Skim off most of the fat, so just 1 to 2 tablespoons remain, but keep the broth below.
  - Transfer the turkey broth to a pot and bring to a boil. Note - If you weren't able to get 2 cups worth through your turkey drippings, you can supplement with turkey or chicken broth.
  - In a separate small bowl, combine the melted butter and arrowroot powder to create a slurry.
  - Once the broth is boiling, turn off the heat, and gradually whisk the slurry into the broth until it begins to thicken. If you'd like the gravy thicker, you can add another tablespoon of arrowroot powder mixed with a tablespoon water.
  - Season with salt and pepper, then pour into a gravy boat. The gravy will continue to thicken as it cools.
