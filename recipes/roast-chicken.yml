source: https://www.recipetineats.com/roast-chicken/#wprm-recipe-container-25307
ingredients:
  - 1.75 - 2 kg / 3.5 - 4lb whole chicken , patted dry
  - Salt and pepper
  - 2 tsp olive oil
  - 1 lemon, quartered
  - 3 rosemary sprigs
  - title: BUTTER
    ingredients:
      - 100 g / 1 stick unsalted butter , melted
      - 3 garlic cloves , minced
      - 1 tbsp sage , finely chopped (Note 1)
      - 2 tsp rosemary , finely chopped (Note 1)
      - 1 tbsp parsley , finely chopped (Note 1)
      - 1/2 tsp each salt and black pepper
  - title: UNDER CHOOK
    ingredients:
      - 1 cup / 250 ml dry white wine , or low sodium chicken broth
      - 1 onion , quartered (Note 2)
      - 1 garlic bulb
      - Few carrots, chopped
steps:
  - Take the chicken out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.
  - Preheat oven to 220C/450F (standard) or 200C/430F (fan/convection). Put shelf in the middle.
  - Mix together Butter ingredients. Add juice from 2 wedges of lemon.
  - Place chicken in a roasting pan. Use a dessert spoon to loosen skin from chicken (see video). Do the top (the breast) and the drumsticks – not the underside.
  - Prop chicken upright, drizzle butter under skin, using most of the garlic/herb sludge, but saving a bit of butter for the skin (Note 3).
  - Drizzle / smear remaining butter all over surface of the chicken. Squeeze over juice of 2 lemon wedges.
  - Stuff used lemon wedges and rosemary inside chicken.
  - Tie drumstick ends with string and tuck wing tips under the chicken.
  - Sprinkle all over with salt and pepper.
  - Place onion and garlic in the pan, place chicken on top. Pour wine around, drizzle chicken with oil.
  - Transfer to oven. Roast for 10 minutes, then turn oven down to 180C/350F (all oven types). Roast for a further 1 hr 15 minutes, or until the internal temperature is 75C/165F or until juices run clear when pierced at the join between the drumstick and the body. Baste twice (30 min then at 1 hr), spooning pan juices over skin.
  - Rest for 15 minutes – don’t cover, skin becomes wet.
  - Serve with pan juices (see video for how to carve). I discard onion but use the garlic in the pan. See notes for side suggestions & how to use carcass for incredible homemade broth!
notes:
  - Under chook can be strained and served as a side.
