source: https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a41995078/cajun-green-bean-casserole-recipe/
ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more for the water
  - 2 lb. green beans, ends trimmed, halved crosswise
  - Tbsp. plus 1 teaspoon olive oil
  - 4 strips bacon, chopped
  - 3 garlic cloves, chopped
  - 2 stalks celery, chopped
  - 1 small onion, chopped
  - 1 small red bell pepper, chopped
  - 1 Tbsp. plus 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning
  - 4 Tbsp. salted butter
  - 1/4 c. all-purpose flour
  - 2 1/2 c. whole milk
  - 1/2 c. half-and-half
  - 2 tsp. hot sauce
  - 2 2.8-oz. cans crispy fried onions (about 3 cups)
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 375Â°. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the green beans and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain and run under cold water. Pat dry.
  - Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Scatter in the bacon and cook, stirring, until just crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, celery, onion and bell pepper; cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning. Remove from the heat.
  - Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Sprinkle in the flour and stir to make a paste. Cook for 2 minutes, then whisk in the milk and half-and-half. Adjust the heat so the sauce is simmering gently and cook until thick and smooth, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the hot sauce and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.
  - Add the bacon-vegetable mixture and the green beans to the dutch oven; mix well to coat the green beans. Transfer to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Toss the fried onions with the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in a medium bowl. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning and toss again. Scatter over the top of the casserole. Bake until the sauce is bubbly and the topping is browned, about 15 minutes.
notes:
  - Frozen green beans can be substituted
  - The everyday pan can be used for the saute and then moved to the oven.
