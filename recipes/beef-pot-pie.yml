    Brown pieces of meat on all sides in a saucepan over medium heat. 
    Pour in some water to almost cover. Bring to a boil and reduce heat. 
    Simmer until meat is tender and falls apart easily; 2 to 3 hours. 
    If using ground beef, brown.
  - Transfer meat to a large mixing bowl. Shred the meat slightly and add salt and pepper to taste.
  - Meanwhile, in another 2-quart saucepan over medium heat, pour in beef broth and add carrots and potatoes. Cook until almost tender; 15 to 20 minutes.
  - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
  - When carrots and potatoes are done, transfer to the large mixing bowl with the beef; leaving the liquid in the pan. Combine peas with carrots, potatoes, and beef.
  - Dissolve cornstarch with 1/3 cup water. Pour into the saucepan with beef broth, stirring constantly. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat; cook for 5 minutes.
  - Line a 9-inch pie plate with one of the pie crusts following the package directions. Place the beef mixture into the pie crust. Pour the gravy over the top of the mixture, then cover with the other pie crust.
  - Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown; about 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
