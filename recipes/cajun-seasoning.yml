ingredients:
  - 3 tablespoons paprika (see note 1)
  - 2 tablespoons garlic powder
  - 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning (see note 2)
  - 2 tablespoons Salt optional (see note 3)
  - 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper (see note 4)

steps:
  - In a small bowl, combine paprika, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, cayenne pepper, thyme, and onion powder. Store in an airtight container.
notes:
  - 'Paprika: Both sweet and smoked paprika work here.'
  - 'Italian seasoning: To make your own, add 1 ½ teaspoons EACH of dried basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and marjoram. If you’re missing one, just leave it out.'
  - 'Salt: Add salt to taste (I like 2 tablespoons), or leave it out of the blend and salt your individual dishes as you go.'
  - 'Cayenne pepper: Dial the heat up or down with more or less cayenne pepper (omit it entirely if you don’t like spicy food).'
  - 'Yield: This recipe makes ¾ cup seasoning.'
  - 'Storage: Store covered in a dark, cool place for up to 6 months.'
