source: https://iowagirleats.com/crock-pot-italian-beef-sandwiches/#wprm-recipe-container-145893
ingredients:
  - 3 lb chuck roast, trimmed of visible fat then cut into large pieces
  - 1 envelope Italian salad dressing mix
  - 8 oz pepperoncini pepper slices + splash of juice, plus extra peppers for serving
  - 8 oz Chicago-Style Giardiniera, drained, plus extra for serving
  - 14.5 oz can beef broth
  - provolone cheese slices
  - buns
steps:
  - Place chuck roast into the bottom of a 6 quart crock pot then sprinkle with salad dressing mix. Add pepperoncini peppers plus a splash of juice, drained Giardiniera, and beef broth then lift up chuck roast pieces to get broth underneath. Place a lid on top then cook on low for 9 hours, or until meat shreds easily with a fork. Shred then place meat back into juices inside crock pot and cook on low for 1 more hour.
  - Split buns in half then scoop the shredded meat mixture on top and add provolone cheese slices (if using gluten free buns, toast/broil first). Top with additional pepperoncini peppers and Giardiniera, if desired, then serve.
