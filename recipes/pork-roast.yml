source: https://www.modernfarmhouseeats.com/instant-pot-pork-roast/#recipe
ingredients:
  - 3 tablespoons olive oil
  - 2-3 pound bonless pork butt/shoulder
  - 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 ½ cups chicken broth
  - 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  - 2 tablespoons cornstarch
  - 2 tablespoons cold water
  - ½-1 pound carrots, cut into large chunks
  - ½-1 pound potatoes, cut into large chunks
  - 2 tablespoons brown sugar
  - ½ tablespoon chili powder
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - ½ tablespoon onion powder
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 1 teaspoon paprika
  - ½ teaspoon cumin
  - ½ teaspoon ground thyme
  - ½ teaspoon black pepper
steps:
  - Mix together all the dry rub spices in a small bowl. Sprinkle and rub the dry rub all over the pork, generously covering all sides.
  - Turn the Instant Pot on to the sauté feature and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once hot, add the pork roast. Sear for the pork roast for about 2 minutes on each side, or until nicely browned. Use tongs to stand the pork roast in the pot to sear the short edges. Once seared, remove to a plate.
  - Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and onion to the Instant Pot. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until it starts to soften. Add the garlic and cook another minute.
  - Pour in the chicken broth and balsamic vinegar, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any brown bits - this where the flavor is! Add the pork roast back into the pot.
  - Lock the lid on and check that the valve is set to seal. Set to cook on high pressure for 70 minutes for a 2 lb roast or 80 minutes for a 3 lb roast. When the cook time is up, quick release the pressure.
  - Add the potatoes and carrots to the Instant Pot with the pork roast. Lock the lid and check that the valve is set to seal. Set to cook for 4 minutes on HIGH pressure. When the cook time is up, quick release the pressure. Transfer the pork and vegetables to a serving dish or plate, leaving the onions and broth in the pot.
  - To make the gravy, mix together the cornstarch and cold water. Turn the Instant Pot to the sauté feature. Once the broth is boiling, pour in the cornstarch slurry while whisking, until the broth has thickened.
  - Serve the pot roast and vegetables with the gravy.
