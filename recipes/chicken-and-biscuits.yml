ingredients:
  - 1/2 Rotisserie chicken
  - 4 tablespoons butter
  - 1 medium onion, chopped
  - 1/2 cup flour
  - 2 1/4 cups chicken stock or broth 
  - 1 1/2 cups milk (preferably whole, but 2% works)
  - 3/4 teaspoon marjoram or thyme
  - 3/4 teaspoon onion powder
  - 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
  - 3 tablespoons dry sherry
  - 2 1/2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed and then if necessary, drained
  - 2 to 3 cups shredded chicken
  - 3/4 cup preferably large grated cheddar cheese, divided
  - 10 small refrigerated Pillsbury Grand biscuits, or equivalent of another brand, another type of biscuit, or homemade biscuits
  - 1 tablespoon butter, melted
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 400 degrees F, adjust oven rack to lower middle.
  - Heat butter to medium-high in a one-and-a-half to two-quart saucepan and saute onions till just tender, about five minutes.
  - Add flour, and cook, stirring constantly for about a minute.
  - Add the stock in splashes, whisking constantly, then do the same with the milk.  
  - Add in the marjoram or thyme, onion powder, and garlic powder.
  - Bring to a simmer and reduce to low, simmering about one minute till sauce fully thickens, stirring constantly.
  - Add sherry and stir. 
  - Remove from heat.
  - Gently stir in the vegetables and chicken, salt, and pepper.
  - Taste and adjust seasoning. At this point, the dish should taste just slightly salty. 
  - Place in a casserole, cover, and bake for 10 minutes.
  - Remove, sprinkle with 1/2 cup cheese, top with biscuits, trying to leave a little space between them. Use remaining cheese, a pinch on each biscuit.
  - Place back in oven, uncovered, and cook until the biscuits are cooked through and crispy and browned on the top, about 14 minutes. Serve immediately.
notes:
  - 8 biscuits is enough for this
  - The whole thing can be made in the everyday pan.
