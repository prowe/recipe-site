ingredients:
  - 10 ounces fresh or frozen baby lima beans (2 cups)
  - 4 center-cut bacon slices
  - 1 cup chopped sweet onion (from 1 small onion)
  - 4 ounces fresh okra, cut into ½-inch-thick slices (1 cup)
  - 1 garlic clove, finely chopped (1 tsp.)
  - 3 cups fresh corn kernels (4 ears)
  - 1¼ teaspoons kosher salt
  - ¼ teaspoon black pepper
  - 3 tablespoons butter
  - 5 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved (1 cup)
  - ¼ cup thinly sliced fresh basil
steps:
  - 'Cook lima beans: Place lima beans in a medium saucepan, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Reduce to medium-low, and simmer until beans are just tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.'
  - "Cook bacon: While beans simmer, place bacon slices in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook until crisp, about 8 minutes, turning once after 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels; crumble and set aside. Reserve drippings in skillet."
  - "Sauté the veggies: Add chopped onion, fresh okra, and garlic to skillet over medium, and cook, stirring often, until onion is just tender, about 6 minutes."
  - "Stir in fresh corn kernels, salt, pepper, and drained beans, and cook, stirring often, until corn is tender and bright yellow, 5 to 6 minutes. Add butter, and cook, stirring constantly, until butter is melted, about 1 minute. Remove from heat."
  - "Stir in halved cherry tomatoes and sliced basil; sprinkle with crumbled bacon, and serve immediately."
notes: 
  - Frozen okra and corn can be used.
  - dried basil can be used.
