ingredients:
  - 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided ( or as needed)
  - 4 bone-in pork chops
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 teaspoons chopped, fresh thyme
  - 1 cup diced onions
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 cup chicken broth
  - 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
  - 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  - 3 tablespoons light brown sugar
  - 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
steps:
  - Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy skillet over MEDIUM-HIGH heat, add the pork chops. Cook the chops for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side, or until nicely browned, seasoning both sides with salt, fresh ground pepper, and fresh thyme. Transfer browned chops to a plate and set aside.
  - Drain grease from pan and add remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Reduce heat to MEDIUM and add onions to pan. Cook and stir for about a minute and then add garlic. Cook until onions are softened and lightly browned, being careful not to burn the garlic. Add the chicken broth, Dijon, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce to the pan and cook, stirring for about a minute. Add the chops back to the pan, nestling them into the sauce. Increase heat and bring mixture to a boil. Cover the pan tightly, reduce heat, and cook over LOW heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the pork chops are fork-tender.
  - If you prefer to use the oven, cover the skillet (ovenproof) or transfer to a baking pan and cover tightly with foil. Braise the pork chops at 325 degrees for about 45 to 55 minutes, until tender
