title: Jägerschnitzel
source: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/60708/jagerschnitzel/
ingredients:
  - 1 large egg, beaten
  - 1 cup bread crumbs
  - 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
  - salt and pepper to taste
  - 4 pork steaks or cutlets, pounded thin
  - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 1 medium onion, diced 
  - 1 (8 ounce) can sliced mushrooms
  - 1 ½ cups water
  - 1 cube beef bouillon
  - ½ cup sour cream
  - 1 tablespoon cornstarch
steps:
  - Place beaten egg in a shallow dish. Mix together bread crumbs and flour in a second shallow dish; season with salt and pepper.
  - Dip pork steaks in beaten egg, then press into bread crumb mixture to coat.
  - Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry coated steaks in hot oil until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steaks should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove steaks to a platter and keep warm.
  - Add onion and mushrooms to drippings in the skillet; cook and stir until lightly browned. Pour in water and stir in bouillon cube until dissolved. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
  - Combine sour cream and cornstarch in a small bowl; stir into the skillet. Cook over low heat until sauce is thickened, but do not boil. Spoon sauce over steaks to serve.
