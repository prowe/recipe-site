source: https://www.brianlagerstrom.com/recipes/faster-better-spaghetti-amp-meat-sauce
ingredients:
 - 1lb/450g 80/20 ground chuck 
 - 8oz/225g hot italian pork sausage (I use 2 links) 
 - 200g or 1 med-lrg onion, medium diced 
 - 20g or 4 cloves garlic, minced/pressed 
 - Coarse salt 
 - 1g or 1/2tsp dried oregano 
 - 1g or 1/2tsp red chili flake 
 - 75g or 1/3c tomato paste 
 - 15g or 1Tbsp beef better than bouillon 
 - 28oz/800g can crushed tomatoes 
 - 28oz/800g water (enough water to fill tomato can) 
 - 7-8g or 2tsp granulated sugar 
 - 10g or 3Tbsp fresh basil, chopped 
 - 12oz/340g dried spaghetti (broken in half) 
 - 50g or 1/2c grated parmesan + extra for garnish 
steps:
 - Heat a dutch oven or large heavy bottomed pot over medium high. Add a bit of oil, the ground beef, and sausage, breaking the meat apart into small pieces as it cooks - i use a meat smasher for this. 
 - When the meat begins to brown and is well broken down, stir in the onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt, making sure to scrape up any meat fond stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. 
 - Now is a good time to preheat your oven to 425F/220C. 
 - After 5 minutes of cooking, stir in oregano, chile flake, and tomato paste and cook for a minute or so until tomato paste is well incorporated. 
 - Stir in bouillon and can of crushed tomatoes, water, 6-8g/1.5tsp salt, 7-8g/2tsp sugar and bring to a simmer. 
 - Stir in basil. Add in spaghetti and gently stir and press down to submerge noodles. Simmer for about 60 seconds. 
 - Carefully stir noodles again to fully submerge noodles. Transfer the pot to the oven to cook, uncovered for 16-18 min, gently stirring and submerging at 5 and 10 minutes into cooking. 
 - Taste for doneness and seasoning and adjust if necessary. Stir in grated parm. 
 - Garnish with additional parm.
