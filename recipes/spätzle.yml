ingredients:
  - 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
  - ½ teaspoon salt
  - 2 large eggs
  - ⅔ cup whole milk
  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled (plus 2 tablespoons)
steps:
  - In a medium bowl combine flour and salt and whisk together. In a small bowl combine eggs, milk and melted butter and whisk together. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and whisk together until smooth (batter should be thick).
  - Fill a large pot with water and place over high heat. Once water comes to a boil, add small handful of salt.
  - Using a spätzle maker, or colander with wide holes, add 1 cup batter and push batter through holes into the boiling water. Boil spätzle for 3 to 4 minutes or just until spätzle floats.
  - Using a slotted spoon, drain and transfer spätzle to a large bowl and repeat until all spätzle has been made.
  - Place a large skillet over medium-high heat and melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add spätzle and cook, stirring gently, for 4 to 5 minute, until lightly browned and slightly crisp. Season with salt and pepper, gently toss together and set aside. Keep warm.
