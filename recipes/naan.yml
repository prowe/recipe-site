title: Naan
source: https://www.recipetineats.com/naan-recipe/
ingredients:
  - 1 tsp instant / rapid rise yeast (Note 1)
  - 1/2 cup warm tap water (~40°C/105°F in temperature)
  - 1 tbsp white sugar
  - 2 tbsp milk , full fat (low fat ok too)
  - 1 1/2 tbsp whisked egg, at room temp (around 1/2 an egg, Note 2)
  - 1/2 tsp salt , cooking / kosher
  - 1 3/4 cups bread flour, or all-purpose/plain (Note 3)
  - 30g / 2 tbsp ghee or unsalted butter
steps:
  - "**Bloom yeast**: Mix yeast with warm water and sugar in a small bowl. Cover with cling wrap, leave for 10 minutes until foamy."
  - "**Egg and milk**: Whisk milk and egg together."
  - "**Flour**: Sift flour and salt into a separate bowl."
  - "**Add wet ingredients**: Make a well in the flour, add yeast mixture, and butter and egg mixture. Mix together with a spatula. Once the flour is mostly incorporated, switch to your hands and bring it together into a ball. No kneading is required."
  - "**Proof 1**: Cover the bowl with cling-wrap, then leave in a warm place for 1 – 1.5 hrs until it doubles in size. (Note 7)"
  - "**Cut into 6 pieces**: Place the dough on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 6 equal pieces, then shape into balls into spheres with a smooth surface by stretching the surface and tucking it under (see video)."
  - "**Proof 2**: Place balls on a lightly-floured tray or plate. Sprinkle lightly with flour, cover loosely with a lightweight tea towel. Put in a warm place to rise for 15 minutes until it increases in size by about 50%."
  - '**Roll out**: Place a round on a lightly-floured work surface, flatten with your hand. Roll out into 3 – 4mm / 0.12 – 0.16" thick rounds (about 16cm / 6.5" wide).'
  - "**Heat skillet**: Rub a cast iron skillet with a very light coat of oil using 1/2 tsp oil on a paper towl (unless already well seasoned). Set over high heat until you see wisps of smoke. (Note 8 for other pans)"
  - "**Cook naan**: Place a naan dough in the skillet and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until the underside is deep golden / slightly charred – the surface should get bubbly. Flip then cook the other side for 1 minute until the bubbles become deep golden brown."
  - "**Cook remaining naan**: Remove, set aside, and repeat with remaining naan, taking care to regulate the heat of the skillet so it doesn't get too hot."
  - "**Finishing**: Brush freshly cooked naan with melted butter or ghee (or garlic butter, Note 5). Sprinkle with nigella seeds and coriander. Serve hot!"
